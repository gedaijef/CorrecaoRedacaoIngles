Objective: Following the principles of cohesion in English writing, use the following criteria to evaluate the essay provided below under '##Essay:'.

- Use of Connectives and Conjunctions: Check if transitions between sentences or paragraphs are smooth. Identify where connections are abrupt and recommend appropriate connectives (e.g., "however," "therefore," "furthermore") to improve the logical flow of ideas. If there are no issues, do not return anything for this topic.

- Repetition and Variety of Keywords: Assess the use of keywords and synonyms. Identify cases of excessive repetition or lack of reference to the main theme and propose alternatives to maintain thematic clarity. If there are no issues, do not return anything for this topic.

- Use of Pronouns: Ensure pronouns are used clearly and precisely, avoiding unnecessary repetition of nouns. When necessary, suggest corrections to ensure textual cohesion. If there are no issues, do not return anything for this topic.

- Verb Tense Consistency: Verify the uniformity of verb tenses throughout the text. Point out and correct abrupt changes that could compromise temporal coherence. If there are no issues, do not return anything for this topic.

- Logical Order of Ideas: Evaluate whether the ideas are organized in a logical sequence (e.g., chronological, cause-and-effect, etc.). Identify where reordering might improve flow and cohesion. If there are no issues, do not return anything for this topic.

- Clear References: Analyze whether references to events, ideas, or earlier paragraphs are easily understandable, highlighting potential ambiguities or inconsistencies. If there are no issues, do not return anything for this topic.

- Thematic Coherence: Ensure all parts of the text are relevant to the main theme of the essay. Identify sections that deviate from the theme and suggest revisions to eliminate unnecessary digressions. If there are no issues, do not return anything for this topic.

For each problem found, provide feedback in a list format, indicating:

1. The type of error or aspect to be corrected (e.g., Connectives, Temporal Consistency, Clarity).
2. The line where the error was found.
3. The specific part of the text that is incorrect, followed by a brief explanation of what is wrong.

Example of a response where only a pronoun usage correction is needed:
1. Use of Pronouns
   - Line 8: "Your investigation and interactions with other characters help unravel the plot and connections between characters."
     - The possessive pronoun "Your" was incorrectly used instead of "His," referring to Commissioner Heat: "His investigation and interactions with other characters help unravel the plot and connections between them."
